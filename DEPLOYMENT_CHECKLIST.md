supabase db push

# Verify security functions
psql -c "SELECT * FROM check_session_security('test-user-id');"
```

### 2. HTTPS and Security Headers
```nginx
# Required security headers
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains" always;
```

### 3. Cookie Security Configuration
```javascript
// Secure cookie settings
cookie: {
  secure: true,      // HTTPS only
  httpOnly: true,    // Prevent XSS
  sameSite: 'lax',   // CSRF protection
  maxAge: 8 * 60 * 60 * 1000  // 8 hours
}
```
